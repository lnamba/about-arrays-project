# All About Arrays

This project was submitted as a final project for a class, CIS166AA - Introduction to JavaScripting, I took through Mesa Community College.

Our assignment was to create a webpage or series of pages regarding some JavaScript we covered during the course. We needed to use [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) to display code snippets and "teach" classmates about our topic. My website "All About Arrays," discusses arrays and how to use various Array methods.
